I am a rising third-year graduate student in Astrophysics at Caltech, working with Prof. [Phil Hopkins](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/) on understanding magnetic fields in galaxies through the use of high-resolution, cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. I'm particularly interested in working closely with observations to constrain theoretical predictions, as well as leveraging theory to make predictions for future observations. My interest in magnetic fields and galaxies is broad; ranging from questions of how magnetic fields can influence cool gas accretion from the halos of galaxies to understanding amplification mechanisms of the magnetic fields over cosmological time.

I grew up in the city of Montego Bay, Jamaica, before moving to the United States, where I lived in the states of New York and Iowa. I did my undergraduate degrees in Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics at the [University of Iowa](https://physics.uiowa.edu/), where I worked with Prof. [Phil Kaaret](http://astro.physics.uiowa.edu/~kaaret/) and Prof. [Hai Fu](https://physics.uiowa.edu/people/hai-fu) on studying [metallicity effects on high-mass X-ray binary populations](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/491/3/3606/5601395), and understanding [cool gas accretion in a high redshift galaxy](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abdb32/pdf). During my undergraduate studies, I had the wonderful opportunity to spend a semester and a summer in Scotland, where I attended the University of Edinburgh. While there, I worked with Prof. [Sadegh Khochfar](https://www.roe.ac.uk/~sadeghk/), Prof. [Jose Onorbe](http://www.joseonorbe.com/), and Prof. [Britton Smith](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/britton-smith) on studying Local Group analogs in large volume cosmological simulations.
